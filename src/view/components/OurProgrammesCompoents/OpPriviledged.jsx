                  <strong>Introduction</strong>
                  <br />
                  Privileged children are those who are born into families that
                  have the resources, opportunities, and social advantages that
                  many others may not have access to. These children grow up in
                  environments that often prioritize their education,
                  well-being, and access to opportunities, setting them on paths
                  to success. This section explores what it means to be a
                  privileged child and how privilege can influence a child's
                  development and perspective on the world.

                  instilling a sense of responsibility, empathy, and
                  self-awareness, we can help these children develop into
                  thoughtful, compassionate, and successful individuals who use
                  their advantages for the greater good.

                  <strong>Understanding Privilege in Childhood</strong> <br />
                  Privilege in childhood is more than just financial wealth-it
                  includes access to quality education, healthcare, supportive
                  environments, and exposure to enriching experiences. These
                  advantages shape a child's future, giving them opportunities
                  that many others might not have. <br />
                  While privilege provides comfort and security, it also comes
                  with the responsibility to grow into compassionate, aware, and
                  purpose-driven individuals.
