                  At ATAL FOUNDATION, we believe that sustainable livelihoods
                  are the key to breaking the cycle of poverty and fostering
                  self- reliance. Our mission is to create opportunities that
                  enable individuals, especially in rural and underprivileged
                  communities, to earn a dignified living through skill
                  development, entrepreneurship, and employment support.
